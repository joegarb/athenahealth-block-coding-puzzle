# athenahealth-block-coding-puzzle

This was my submission to athenahealth for a job interview in 2012. I found the puzzle interesting enough to share! The PDF with the puzzle description is included here. Notably, I've never used Java professionally and hadn't written it since 2006 until this assignment! However, athena wouldn't accept a submission using my choice at the time, .NET.

It was relatively simple to come up with an initial solution that produced the right answers, but was far too slow to arrive at the answer to the number of 48x10 panels that can be built. The final solution required coming up with an interesting solution! (see Step 3 in the code)

The answer it produces to number of 48x10 panels that can be built is 806844323190414 (806.8 trillion), which is computed within 100 milliseconds.
